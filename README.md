# BitcoinDevOffer

To celebrate the launch of Cloaked Wireless, we are offering a limited time promotion to the open source developers who have made major contributions to one of the most important technologies of our time. 

Core Bitcoin developers with 10 or more commits can get free wireless for life*.  No need to port your existing number in, feel free to experiment with a totally new number, use lightning login with a fresh wallet and enjoy unmatched private wireless service.

Any core BTC developer with fewer than 10 commits but more than 5 can receive a $500 credit towards their Cloaked Wireless account. 

Some of the conditions are as follows:
-Must be based in the USA
-Does not include international long distance or international roaming
-”Free wireless for life” means the ability to activate an account and access any Cloaked Wireless plan at no cost for that account for as long as Cloaked Wireless provides those services.
-Cloaked Wireless reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that are inactive and/or unused for a period greater than 6 months
-Subject to Cloaked Wireless standard terms and conditions
-This is a limited time offer. 

To claim this promotion, please create an issue in the CloakedServices BitcoinDevOffer repo on github from the username associated with your contributions. 

Thank you for your service!
